This code attempts to extract patient information from a doctor's referral and then parse it into a PA pdf file . The extraction is done with Llama Parse API . Filling in the pdf is done with a vision model that attempts to convert images of the empty pdf into fields that the llm tries to map to the extracted information . Finally, a third llm Qwen 2.7 tries to print the output info in the empty pdf , the final parse pdf is filled_PA_form_dynamic.pdf
